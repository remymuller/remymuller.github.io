I just received my Arduino Kit. 

![Arduino2]({{ site.url }}/images/arduino2.jpeg)
![Arduino1]({{ site.url }}/images/arduino1.jpeg)

It's been a long time that I wanted to start playing with it to refresh my rusty electrical engineering skills and start hacking ideas in the real world not just inside computers.

Here's a first toy example that uses the push button to toggle the LED on and off. 
This is the simplest example I could think about that wouldn't be easy to do using just analog electronics. 
That kind of logic is much easier with software.


{% highlight cpp %}
int Led = 13;
int Button = 7;
int lastVal = LOW;
int state = LOW; 
int debug = 1;

void setup()
{
  if(debug)
  {  
    Serial.begin(9600);
  }
  pinMode(Button, INPUT);
  pinMode(Led, OUTPUT);
}
    
void loop()
{
    int val = digitalRead(Button);
    if(lastVal != val && val == HIGH) // rising front
    {
        // toggle state
        if(state == LOW)
        {
            state = HIGH;
        }
        else
        {
            state = LOW;
        }
        
        if(debug)
        {      
            Serial.println(state);    
        }
    }
    lastVal = val;
      
    digitalWrite(Led, state);
    delay(1);
}
{% endhighlight %}
