    This is my house: 

    For several years my work has been centered on the writing itself of choreography  
    writing that implies the creation of special signals used to compose the dance ahead 
    of the rehearsals with the dancers and on the integration in this writing of 
    computerized devices of disturbance and re-generation of the pre-written composition 
    in real time. 

    The goal of this research is to invite the performer to co-create an open score. 
    For "This is my house" the five dancers pilot the process of modification of the 
    choreographic score by their breath and by slow movements  thanks to the collecting 
    system developed by the IRCAM  which shows up on LCD screens placed above. 
    Therefore, the technology  the computer device at the heart of the relations between 
    time and spaces  allows the structure of situations, of original contexts that the 
    dancers interpret, as the piece develops and unfolds.

This is a performance for 5 dancers wearing [Wi-Fi sensors](http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/temps-reel/movement/flety/static.php?page=static050309-144808) (accelerometers, optical-flex, standard flex and breath sensors). A dance score ([Laban notation](http://notation.free.fr/) customized by Myriam Gourfink) is generated in real-time driven by the interpretation of the dancers and displayed on 12 LCD monitor facing the floor on a structure over the dancers. A computer is in charge of receiving the sensor data and performs various kind analysis in order to trigger and generate the score to be displayed.


## analysis performed on the sensors


cyclicity detection through generalized autocorrelation

synchronicity between dancers for different sensors

activity of each dancer

[phrase recognition](http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/temps-reel/movement/muller/static.php?page=static041126-184936) using Hidden Markov Models so that dancers have control over the time of the performace.

all the analysis is performed using the [MnM/FTM](http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/temps-reel/ftm/mnm.html) library for MaxMSP.
