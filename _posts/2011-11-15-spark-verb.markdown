I'm testing the delay modulation algorithm for a new reverb I'm working on. It is not meant to faithfully reproduce natural room reverberation (but I don't mind if it does). Rather delay length modulation is meant to be heard as a blend between chorus / reverberation  / ensemble / unison.

Here are some cinematic examples made with a very crude Feedback Delay Network prototype made in MaxMSP with only 4 delays and no loop filtering. Delay times were set manually without special care about being mutually prime.
RT60: 10 seconds
Modulation depth: 10-20 cents
