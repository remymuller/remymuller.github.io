I'm testing the delay modulation algorithm for a new reverb I'm working on. It is not meant to faithfully reproduce natural room reverberation (but I don't mind if it does). Rather delay length modulation is meant to be heard as a blend between chorus / reverberation  / ensemble / unison.

Here are some cinematic examples made with a very crude Feedback Delay Network prototype made in MaxMSP with only 4 delays and no loop filtering. Delay times were set manually without special care about being mutually prime.
RT60: 10 seconds
Modulation depth: 10-20 cents

* [Contrebasse]({{ site.url }}/sounds/mp3/SparkVerb_Contrebasse.mp3)
* [Cello1]({{ site.url }}/sounds/mp3/SparkVerb_Cello.mp3)
* [Cello2]({{ site.url }}/sounds/mp3/SparkVerb_Cello2.mp3)
* [Koto]({{ site.url }}/sounds/mp3/SparkVerb_Koto.mp3)
* [Toy guitar]({{ site.url }}/sounds/mp3/SparkVerb_TriggeredGuitar.mp3) 

Edit: This early prototype has considerably evolved into a dedicated product which is now called [SparkVerb](https://www.uvi.net/software/sparkverb.html) and is available as an audio plugin.
